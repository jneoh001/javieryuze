## Contributing to the project

**READ THE FOLLOWING BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES.**

1. Ensure that you have fetched **AND** pulled the latest master branch into your local repository before making changes.
2. After pulling in the latest repository, you want to make changes on a separate branch so it doesn't affect the origin (master) branch. Select **Current branch -> New branch**. Name it whatever you want. You will now be working within your own branch and can make all your changes there.
3. Make any changes to your local repository as required. **DO NOT DELETE, CUT OR COPY ANY FOLDERS/FILES.** You should only create new files.
4. When committing changes, **please check the changes list to ensure that the changes are correct.** Commit your changes to your newly created branch that you are working in.
5. Push your commits to the new branch.
6. Submit a pull request to the master branch (it should pop up after you commit to the new branch).
7. After approval and review, your pull request will be accepted into the master branch.

## Updating your own branch
1. To update your branch from the master branch, select **Branch -> Update from master**. This will commit any updates from master into your current branch.
2. Thereafter, push the commits from master to your own branch. Your branch is now up to date with the master branch.


## Important notes

- If it's your first time contributing, make sure to pull and fetch from the master branch before commiting anything.
- DO NOT pull from the master branch if you have changes on your local repository. All your changes will be lost. Instead, push all your changes to a new branch and submit a pull request.
- If you want to make further changes BEFORE the master branch is updated, make a new branch of your pending branch and work from there.
